# Games-Puzzles

This repository contains all the games and puzzle I implemented, mostly using python:


1. Tic-Tac-Toe game (Python): no explaination required.
2. Bulb Puzzle (Python): You have 3 bulbs on 1st floor, and 3 switches on ground floor. You can turn switches on/off any number of times but you are allowed to go to first floor (where bulbs located) only once. You need to find out which bulb belongs to which switch.
